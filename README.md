# IP2F

This will make a file named IP_ADDRESS_[CURRENTUSER].txt containing the Pulbic IP and active username of the device connected to. It will wait until you open the Mass Storage app on the 
 Flipper Zero and open an .img file with the name, "MAXUS".
 It then moves the IP_ADDRESS_[CURRENTUSER].txt to the drive and deletes it from the system.
 The name can be changed to whatever you like by using CTRL+F to replace MAXUS in the program itself. Just be sure it matches in the documents window once the drive is loaded.

NOTE: You switch to the Mass Storage app once the BadKB script reads 100%.
