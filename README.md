# IP2F

This program will find the Public IP and active username of the device plugged into and will wait until you load the Mass Storage app with an .img file named "MAXUS" to save the file locally to the .img file.
It will then delete the file from the system.
The name can be changed to whatever you like by using CTRL+F to replace MAXUS in the program itself. Just be sure it matches in the documents window.

NOTE: You switch to the Mass Storage app once the BadKB script reads 100%.
